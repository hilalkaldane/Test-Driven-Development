# Test Driven Development
This project shows a <b>Test Driven Development (TDD)</b> approach of writing a code which demonstrates the significance of writing code according to test cases.
</br>In TDD approach we do the task in following order.
1. Define test case: with input and expected output for a method.
2. Write logic for that particular method.
3. 
   1. If expected ouput matches with output of our method, move on.
   2. Else make changes in logic till the output matches.
